Projects in Artifact Chat provide a powerful way to organize your AI conversations, assistants, and content. Whether you're working solo or with a team, projects help keep your work structured and accessible.

## What is a Project?

A project is a dedicated environment that contains:

- **Threads**: Conversation histories with AI assistants
- **Assistants**: Custom AI configurations for specific tasks
- **Files**: Uploaded documents and resources
- **Settings**: Project-specific configurations

<Note>
  Every user has a Personal Project by default. You can create additional projects for different work streams or teams.
